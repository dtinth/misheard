# misheard

A stupid chat application that uses speech-to-text to recognize the text. You have only one chance to say each message, and it will send it to the room. The message cannot be edited or deleted.

Uses Yjs and Y-webrtc. Messages sent in a peer-to-peer fashion. If everyone leave the room then the message history will be lost.
